# MorseListening
This is a project running on Ardoino UNO/Nano.
This project is being developping when I have time.
It's a Morse code lisening practise device to play Morse code by a passive buzzer and controled by a infrared remote control.<br>

The hardware is mainly constructed with the following parts:<br>
An Ardoino UNO<br>
An IR Receiver 1838<br>
A passive buzzer<br>
An LED<br>
some resistors, etc.<br>
