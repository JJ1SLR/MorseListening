# MorseListening
This is a project running on Ardoino UNO/Nano.
This project is being developping when I have time.
It's a Morse code lisening practise device to play Morse code by a passive buzzer and controled by a infrared remote control.

The hardware is mainly constructed with the following parts:
An Ardoino UNO
An IR Receiver 1838
A passive buzzer
An LED
some resistors, etc.
