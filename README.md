# MorseListening
This is a project running on Arduino UNO/Nano.<br>
The first version (V0.1.0) of this project was released on Oct. 24, 2020<br>
It's a Morse code listening practice device to play Morse code by a passive buzzer and controlled by a infrared remote controller.<br>

The morse code here is stipulated by the Japanese law [無線局運用規則　別表第一号　モールス符号（第十二条関係）]
(https://www.tele.soumu.go.jp/horei/reiki_honbun/72393000001.html)<br>
But the Wabun code is not supported.
