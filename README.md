# MorseListening
This is a project running on Ardoino UNO/Nano.<br>
This project is on development when I have time.<br>
It's a Morse code listening practice device to play Morse code by a passive buzzer and controlled by a infrared remote controller.<br>

The hardware is mainly constructed with the following parts:<br>
An Ardoino UNO<br>
An 1602A LCD display<br>
An IR Receiver 1838<br>
A passive buzzer<br>
An LED<br>
some resistors, etc.<br>
